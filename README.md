# Talha's Migration

Small educational web game themed on Loggerhead sea-turtle migration. 

## Rough Notes

- work on this game because it's a smaller game and more work per game, over a roguelike (which is a longer-term system but more work)
- main risks are art/animation (simplify animation to start) and unintersting gameplay (prototype)
- turtles vs. tortoises: turtles are more interesting (need to come up for air, lay eggs and dash to the ocean, mostly carnivorous, cold-blooded so temperature of sea matters where they can go). tortoises have wicked humped armoured shell but are not otherwise interesting.
- make it work on the Linux gaming console please

## Gameplay Notes

All of these are lifted from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle).

- Loggerhead Sea Turtles are the most interesting; see the list of predators and prey, which is quite large.
- 95% of americas turtles are born in japan and migrate; and they migrate back to nest.
- eggs are laid in an egg-chamber inside a body-pit (pit in a pit) then covered with sand.
- once born, race to the bright horizon (moon/stars), often losing 20% of body weight to evapouration
- they hide in seaweed
- They can perceive the magnetic field of the earth
- migrate to warmer waters when ocean waters cool
- they can submerge 7h at a time, emerging for 7 minutes only to breathe
- use magnetic clues if visual is not available, and vice-versa; one type is enough (dark areas?!)
- gender and ambient temperature: 28C is all males, 32C is all females, 30C is 50-50 split

Generic turtle facts:
* all newborn turtles are born without parents present or taking care of them
* all newborn turtles must make it to the ocean before predators eat them
